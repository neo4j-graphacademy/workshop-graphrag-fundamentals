== Data

The data is automatically imported into the Neo4j database by GraphAcademy.

The link:./workshop-genai/financial-documents/csv-load/load.cypher[workshop-genai/financial-documents/csv-load/load.cypher^] file contains the Cypher commands that import the data.

[NOTE]
You don't need to import the data yourself. GraphAcademy will do this for you when you enrol in the workshop.
