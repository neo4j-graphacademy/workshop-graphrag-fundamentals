    "### Why \"Apple\" Queries Can Fail in Vector-Cypher Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask a question like \"What are the risks that Apple faces?\" using a vector-Cypher retriever, you may not get the structured or complete answer you expect. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How Vector-Cypher Works:**  \n",
    "  - The retrieval process first performs a semantic search over all text chunks in the graph.\n",
    "  - It retrieves the `top_k` chunks most similar to your query—regardless of which company (or entity) they are about.\n",
    "  - The Cypher query then starts from each chunk and traverses the graph for related information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Problem with Entity-Centric Queries:**  \n",
    "  - If your query is about \"Apple,\" but there are no chunks whose text is semantically similar to your query and also specifically about Apple, the retriever may return:\n",
    "    - Chunks about other companies.\n",
    "    - Chunks that mention \"risk\" but not \"Apple.\"\n",
    "    - Generic or boilerplate risk factor text.\n",
    "  - The Cypher query can only traverse from the retrieved chunk—it cannot \"filter\" or \"redirect\" to Apple if the chunk isn’t already about Apple.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Limitation:**  \n",
    "  - **The chunk is the anchor.** If your query is about an entity (like Apple), but the chunk retrieval is not entity-aware, you may never reach the correct node or context in the graph.\n",
    "  - This is especially problematic for broad or entity-centric questions, where you want to aggregate or summarize information about a specific node (e.g., a company) rather than just retrieve semantically similar passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector-Cypher retrieval is powerful for finding relevant context, but it is fundamentally limited by the chunk-centric approach. For entity-centric questions, you need either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chunks that are explicitly about the entity, or\n",
    "- A retrieval/query strategy that starts from the entity node itself, not from arbitrary text chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## VectorCypherRetriever Example: Detailed Search with Context\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `VectorCypherRetriever` to answer nuanced, relationship-driven questions by combining semantic search with graph traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses the graph to find specific information about asset managers."

    "  - `source_company`: The company from the retrieved chunk.\n",
    "  - `related_companies`: Companies sharing at least one risk with the source company.\n",
    "  - `shared_risks`: The names of the risk factors connecting these companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why this is powerful:**  \n",
    "  - Leverages the chunk as the semantic anchor, but then uses graph logic to discover structured, multi-entity relationships.\n",
    "  - Surfaces both the context (from the chunk) and the broader network of shared risks—something that pure semantic or pure graph search alone would struggle to do as effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is ideal for exploratory questions about relationships in your graph, where you want to start from relevant context but end up with structured, comparative insights.\n"
