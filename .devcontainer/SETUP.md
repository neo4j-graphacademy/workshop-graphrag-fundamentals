# Setup

This repository accompanies the [Neo4j & Generative AI Hands-On Workshop](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/workshop-graphrag-introduction/) on [GraphAcademy](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com).

When the devcontainer is created, such as in a GitHub codespace, all the required software and packages will be installed.

Follow the [Setup Instructions](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/workshop-graphrag-introduction/1-introduction/0-welcome/) to get started.

You will need to:

1. Create a new [`.env`](.env) file and copy the contents of the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file into it
2. Update the environment values in the [`.env`](.env) file with the values in the [Setup Instructions](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/workshop-graphrag-introduction/1-introduction/0-welcome/)
3. Run the [`workshop-genai/test_environment.py`](../workshop-genai/test_environment.py) program to check the environment is set up correctly.
